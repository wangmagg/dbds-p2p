Hi [mentee name],

My name is [mentor name], and I'm a [X] year [MS/PhD] student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford. I'm excited to be your mentor for the Stanford BDS Peer-2-Peer program!

Let me know what your availability is like in the next 2 weeks for a 30-minute Zoom call to walk through your statement of purpose. Before we chat, I'll read through the draft you shared with us and will send you some initial feedback that we can use to help guide our conversation. I'll also be happy to spend some time answering questions you may have about the application process and what it's like to be part of Stanford BDS.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
[mentor name]

Happy mentoring!
